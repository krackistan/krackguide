        <h1>Home</h1>
        <p>Welcome to CZ. It is quite the magnificant shithole.  All of this is an elegant experiment in cooperation, in culture, in diveristy of experience, and in diversity of thought. You can expect suprises, some good some difficult, you can expect to meet beautiful people, you can expect to find yourself or at least find out quite a bit about yourself. Your expectations will fall short.  </p>
        <p> We are all brought here in study. We have chosen to use the opportunity that those who have supported us have afforded. We have maximized the opportunity that we have earned ourselves. All of this in order to spend our time in learning about something bigger than ourselves. Let those conversations about that something bigger flow freely from your lips, they will not fall on deaf ears. </p>
        <p>Welcome home. Here are a few things you might want to know about the place in which you live. </p>

        <h1>Grain</h1>
        <h2>Food Service</h2>
        <p>CZ is a full board cooperative - everything in the house (provided it's not personally labelled) is yours to eat. We have a walk-in refrigerator which keeps all sorts of produce and other perishables, and a walk-in freezer which keeps meats, ice creams, and other frozen goods. There is a smaller fridge in the kitchen for recently opened goods and bits and ends.</p>

        <p>Dinner is served in our common room six nights a week: Monday thru Friday at 7pm, and Sundays at 6pm. These meals are cooked by our members - each day is assigned a head cook and four assistant cooks, who cook for three hours prior to dinner. Head cooks plan the menus for each day, with guidance from the food manager. Dinner will always include vegan/vegetarian and gluten-free options.</p>

        <p>Our kitchen can be accessed at all times, except for on rare occasions (repairs, major out-of-house parties) where the kitchen is closed for safety reasons. During dinner cookshift (4-7 M-F, 3-6 Sun) it is polite to avoid using the stoves and ovens to allow the cook crew to finish dinner on time. You may always ask the head cook if it's okay for you to use kitchen equipment at that time.</p>

        <h2>Food Purchasing</h2>
        <p>As the food manager, I am tasked with purchasing food for the house. We have a truly incredible selection of food here at CZ! If you would like to request specific food items, you can make a request <a href='http://bit.ly/1eAKe62'>here</a></p>
        <p>Due to cost, many purchases are unfortunately not feasible, but I will try to keep as many ingredients stocked as I can.</p>

        <p>Almost all of our produce is purchased through Earl's Organic Produce, a San Francisco supplier. As the name suggests, all of the produce we receive is certified organic. Almost all of the produce we purchase is sourced locally. If you're curious about the particular farms we source our produce from, please feel free to come talk to me.</p>

        <p>The non-produce food items that we purchase are ordered by CFS (Central Food and Supplies), which is the BSC's centralized purchasing. CFS receives orders from all of the board houses, consolidates the orders, then distributes the order to each house. There are many different suppliers; if you'd like to know which ones, please come speak with me.</p>
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>For food requests, I would highly prefer you use this form <a href='http://bit.ly/1eAKe62'>here</a>. It is much more difficult for me to remember requests made in person. I will respond to requests made through that form weekly by email.</p>

        <p>If you have questions about other food things, such as our suppliers, or budgets, or how to cook something, come by sometime. I live in 42. Again, for food requests, please use the form above.</p>

        <p>You can always send me an email at winstonjhuang@gmail.com.</p>

        <h2>Disposal of food from plates</h2>
        <p>All compostable waste gets thrown in to the green bins. 
This includes things like food scraps, brown paper towels, and old egg cartons but not things like foil plastic or glass.</p>
        <h2>When rinsing your plate</h2>
        <p>Make sure to completely rinse off your plate of all remaining food with the spray gun, and then sort them. Cups and plates in the black plastic tubs, silverware in the small clear plastic tubs and all sharp knives should be kept in a separate container.</p>
        <h2>When sanitizing a plate for personal use</h2>
        <p>Use soap and a sponge like your mother taught you.</p>
        <h2>General Kitchen Supplies</h2>
        <p>Are kept in the cabinets in the outer kitchen. If you can’t find anything or you think were out of anything feel free to ask an old czar or let me know so I can reorder them.</p>
        <h2>Overall sanitation</h2>
        <p>Make sure to always clean up your station after you’re done.</p>
        <p>DON’T PUT FOOD IN THE POTS SINK—all food should be first emptied into compost bins and then any remaining little bits only go into sinks with garbage disposals attached.</p>

        <h2>The Cutting boards are color coded</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>The vacuums are generally found in front of the maintenance room. The maintenance room is on the 10's floor, directly left at the bottom of the stairs. </li>
                    <li>The vacuums are backpacks with long hoses connected to silver pipes for extension.</li>
                    <li>If they are not here, then check to see if someone else is using it before going to the maintenance manager. </li>

                    <li>The extension cord plugs into the backpack near the waist belt and also near the power switch. </li>
                    <li>Before using it, make sure the bag is empty. To do this unscrew the top of the canister and remove the cylindrical bag and filter. Empty the bag into the trash and gently remove the dust from the filter.  </li>
                    <li>Replace the bag and make sure the intake port is free of debris. </li>
                    <li>If, while vacuuming it does not seem to be working, make sure the intake is not clogged. If it is not clogged and the problem persists, you may need to remove the canister lid and make sure there is nothing in the black tubing by clearing it with a broom handle or the like. </li>

    <!-- Council section -->
    <div id="council">
        <h1>Commune</h1>
        <h2>Council</h2>
        <p>Self-governance is a fundamental part of what it means to live in a co-operative. Getting a chance to participate in Direct Democracy is pretty cool, and key to knowing what's going on in this house. The general format is as follows: </p>
        <ol>
             <li>Gong rings to start council - because that's how we roll.</li>
             <li>Manager Announcements - super important things usually get said here. You are responsible for reading council minutes to find out what happened at council, if you did not attend.</li>
             <li>Member announcements - Every member has the opportunity to address the house, usually to talk about some cool event which will be taking place</li>
             <li>Agenda Items - these are changes to the bylaws, expenditures, or other various motions which must be passed by the co-operative at council.  We go through these using a variant of Parliamentary Procedure; council members ask questions about motions, comment on motions, and procedurally process motions (for example "calling to question" which means if there are no objections then we vote on the current motion). </li>
             <li>Gong rings to end council - music and merriment generally ensue. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Council is generally held every Sunday night at 6pm.</p>
        <h2>Manager Meetings</h2>
        <p>These meetings are open to anybody in the co-op who is even slightly interested in what's going on in the house and what will be addressed at council. If you want an item to be put on the agenda at council, go to manager meeting! Manager meeting is where the agenda for council is set. It takes place somewhere in common space an hour before each council.</p>
        <h2>Bylaws</h2>
        <p>Are the codification of co-operative behavior we have agreed upon as a house. They can be modified by 2/3s vote on two consecutive councils.  The bylaws contain policy on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Member rules;</li>
            <li>Member obligations;</li>
            <li>Workshift;</li>
            <li>Member disputes and Bylaw enforcement;</li>
            <li>Proper administration of council, and elections;</li>
            <li>Job requirements of managerial positions;</li>
            <li>Other miscellaneous policy governing everything from parking to muraling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're connected to the Internet within the house, the complete bylaws can be found <a href='http://web/wiki/index.php/Bylaws'>here</a></p>
        <h2>A few notable Bylaws</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Members must accompany their guests while those guests are in common space</li>
            <li>Members may not allow their cigarette smoke to enter indoor commons spaces </li>
            <li>Quiet Hours start at 11pm on school nights, and at 1am on all other nights</li>
            <li>Members that leave messes in common spaces are subject to a fine of  one workshift hour.</li>
            <li>Members may not keep house property in their rooms</li>
            <li>Members are encouraged to serve each other at dinner</li>
            <li>Members may make any modification to bathroom walls.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>House Policy</h2>
        <p>House Policy is a series of codified recommendations as to how Czars should behave, and how the bylaws should be enforced.  House Policy is always written in rhyming couplets. Policy is interspersed throughout The Bylaws.</p>
        <h2>Community Agreements</h2>
        <p>Community Agreements  are discussions about house policy and culture among small groups of house members, facilitated by the President. They are mandatory and need to be completed by the second week of the semester, so keep an eye out for an onslaught of emails telling you where and when they will be held.</p>
        <h2>Disorientations</h2>
        <p>Disorientations are opportunities for house members to share important skills which benefit the house. Examples might include "how to use the steam cleaner" or "how to clean the grills" or "how to use the wiki". All attendees and the presenter get workshift for the disorientation. Any member interested in holding a disorientation should talk to me.</p>


    </div>
    <!-- HI section -->
    <div id="hi">
        <h1>Expressive Dynamism</h1>
        <h2>What HI is</h2>
        <p>Home Improvement means everything from maintaining the luxuries we already have, to adding/building/growing more fantastic aspects to our house. Improvement can cover anything from painting a wooden chair to make it look fabulous, to building a three-dimensional garden to grow herbs and flowers. HI managers gain access to the maintenance room and all its tools, so construction projects are made easier. HI managers gain high levels of responsibility in this role: they are able to make small decisions by themselves, such as “Should this rose stay here or be moved to the other side of the Bee Garden?” However, they must consult the house on larger decisions, such as “Shall we spend $500 on installing lawn onto our wooden trellis in the courtyard?” One of the most important aspects of their duties is to aid and assist other members of the house in completing their required HI hours (5 hours during Fall and Spring, 3 hours during Summer semesters). In order to do this, they must repeatedly remind house members of their duties. They must also inspire members with project ideas, assist them in their completion, and ensure safety at all times.
        </p>
        <h2>Notable Projects</h2>
        <p>In the semester just past, Summer 2013, HI included a complete renovation of the Bee Garden from a weeded jungle into a relaxing, open space, ready for grass to be installed. Members also constructed a new, large and secure book case in the study room, as well as cataloguing and sorting our massive library. CZars helped clear the Red Room of excessive amounts of trash and junk furniture, and transform the room into an open, inhabitable space ready for further renovation. During summer, the HI budget was used to purchase everything from shelf brackets, spray paint and glue, to moka pots, hammocks and music stands. Historically, HI has included huge projects, such as the electronic light-board in the common room, the stripper stage, the vegetable cabinet, huge wooden planters and incredibly intricate murals.
        </p>
        <h2>Current Projects</h2>
        <p>
         This coming semester, Fall 2013, it is important that the HI manager finish many projects that were unable to be completed heretofore. Firstly, sod needs to be purchased from Home Depot between 9am-11am on a weekday, and for this to happen, a CZar must borrow the truck from Central Kitchen. As far as I know, only Max French has access to this truck (this is why it was too difficult to get sod in the last few weeks of summer, as Max and Karandeep were busy every morning). Furthermore, the books that were deemed useless to the house were packaged into 10 large boxes, ready to be moved to Half Price Books and sold. Unfortunately, no member was able to transport these books during the last weeks of summer. It is imperative that these are removed from the common space as they are obstructing spaces used by CZars on a daily basis. The library budget Hilary Ojeda passed in Spring 2013 still has over $1,500 left to spend. This should be utilised to carry on the renovation of the study room: new furniture and book shelves, perhaps. Furthermore, much interest was shown during council for arcade machines to be purchased for the Red Room, to aid its renovation. Moreover, comfortable furniture needs to be purchased for the Red Room and other common spaces. This should be done in time for the cold months, when snuggling up in front of the Red Room fire with a book and hot chocolate is an essential aspect of CZars’ weekly routines.
        </p>
        <h2> Brainstorming Potential Projects </h2>
        <p>The best thing to do is talk to CZars about the house, and what they could do to improve it. It’s incredible how imaginative everyone in this house is. Ideas can easily snowball, so proposing projects during council is also a good idea. It is best to test the water with straw-polls before moving to an official budget vote.
        </p>
        <h2>Investing in the place in which you live</h2>
        <p>
It’s incredibly important that members improve the house they inhabit and love. CZ is a microcosm of the real world; it requires nurture and attention and love. Without your help, future generations of students will not be able to enjoy it as much as you have. It is tiring to rebuild a house that receives so much abuse, but it is important to be hopeful, imaginative and optimistic. Countless CZars have poured huge portions of their lives into maintaing and improving this house — don’t let them down!

    <!-- Garden section -->
    <div id="garden">
        <h1>Agriculture</h1>
            <p>Welcome home all czars old and new! You may have noticed some strange green housemates lingering about, especially near the windows. Don’t panic—they’re not aliens, they’re just our friendly czarling plant community. As your chief Czar of Agriculture, I oversee the noble duty of tending and nourishing all the greenery in our chateau on the hill. Here’s a rundown of the house’s main garden areas, to give you an idea of what is growing and where to find it.</p>
            
            <h2>100s wing roof raised beds and potted plants, outside of the study room
            </h2> 
            <p>There will often be tasty veggies to snack on and herbs to peruse and season your cooking with out on this roof. Ask me for a garden tour if you’re not sure what things are or how to harvest them, and I’ll be glad to show you around in person.</p>
            
            <h2>10s wing roof Terra Cotta Warrior Memorial/Bong Graveyard</h2>
            <p>May they rest in succulent peace.</p>
            
            <h2>Center courtyard concrete beds</h2> 
            <p>These host a plethora of cacti friends and exotic trees. Please don’t try to water them with any *~*~*juice*~*~* or use the beds as ashtrays during events—the plants only need water and sunshine to have a good time. </p>
            
            <h2>Bee/Rose Garden</h2> 
            <p>Located down the stairs past the hot tub in the center courtyard. I know, I know, there are no bees there right now. It’s confusing. This spot has recently been lovingly pruned and mulched back to its former glory, with plans for more flowers to come.</p>
            
            <h2>Bed outside the front gate</h2> 
            <p>Shared with Ridge House next door. Soon to be restored to a native California plants section that will welcome you home everyday and make Ridge super jealous, which they totally are anyway.</p>
            
            <p>Our garden spaces can give us beauty and good planty vibes if we water them with care and attention. If you’re into gardening or want to be into gardening (no experience required, really!) contact me at czgarden@gmail.com. A crew of committed czars is really essential in keeping things *growing* so come get your hands dirty outside in the sun and get workshift hours for it! Overalls optional but strongly recommended.</p>

    <!-- Finance section -->
    <div id="finance">
        <h1>Treasury</h1>
        <h2>The House Checking Account</h2>
        <p>Where all the money gets funneled through. It's the money we have to work with during the month.</p>
        <h2>The House Discretionary Account</h2>
        <p>This is basically a cash account. It is mostly used for social expenditures and small reimbursments.</p>
        <h2>The Food Account</h2>
        <p>Used for feeding us. Each semester it is filled to account for each member eating $5.42 per day. Typically we pass extra money in order to account for our extravegant food purchases and special dinner.
        <h2>The Furniture Account</h2>
        <p>Used to purchase the items that the BSC guarantees members will have if desired: a bed, a desk, a chair, a dresser, a wardrobe, etc. It can also be used to purchase utilities for the house that will last longer than five years. Some recent purchases that have decimated the account include the hot water dispenser and the new grills.</p> 
        <h2>The Decentralized Maintenance Account</h2>
        <p>Used for maintaining our home for things that Central Maintenance won't pay for. It is filled at the beginning of the semester at $10 per member. We can use it to buy tools and non-white paints</p>
        <h2>HAPS</h2>
        <p> <a href='http://www.bsc.coop/policy/index.php/V.B._HAPs_Procedure'>House Approved Projects</a> or HAPS are central level's way of ensuring the value of the BSC properties does not decrease with time.</p> 
        <p>Every fiscal year each of the individual BSC houses is alotted money for House Improvement projects. These projects must be approved at council, they must be useful for longer than five years, they must add value to the house, be a permanent installation and cost at least $500.
        <h2>BAPS</h2>
        <p> When the scope of House Approved Projects exceeds support from the house, it can be approved by Board for more money.<a href='http://www.bsc.coop/policy/index.php/V.C._Board_Approved_Projects_%26_House_Level_BAPs_%28HLBAPs%29'>Board Approved Projects</a> recieve funding based on a ranked priority list with projects from each of the houses. Projects that increase the value of the BSC's assets are prioritized. Each of the approved projects must be discussed at two Maintenance Committee Meetings and two Board meetings. </p>

    <!-- Health Section -->
    <div id="health">
        <h1>Chirurgery</h1>
        <h2>Health Supplies</h2>
        <p>As far as in the health cabinet goes, in there you can find items such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>cold medicine</li>
            <li>vitamins</li>
            <li>bandages/medical tape</li>
            <li>feminine items (female sanitary napkins) </li>
            <li>condoms (male and female) </li>
        </ul>
        <p>*note: If there is something in the health cabinet that czars feel that they are missing, they can come to the health managers and ask us to buy more.</p>
    
        <h2>Harm Reduction for Recreational Drug Use</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Drink plenty of water, eat well, sleep regularly, exercise. These four things can go a long way in counteracting any unhealthy activities.</li>
            <li>Be very careful when mixing drugs. Stimulants (cocaine, Adderall, etc.) and depressants (alcohol, benzos, opiates) strongly co-potentiate. That means if you mix two stimulants or two depressants you should take significantly less of each.</li>
            <li>Drinking more does not mean you will have more fun.</li>
            <li>Drinking is not a competition.</li>
            <li>When taking a new drug, start small. There's always next time.</li>
            <li>You can always take more, but you can't take less.</li>
            <li>If you choose to take MDMA, do so infrequently and in reasonable amounts.</li>
            <li>Mixing cocaine and alcohol forms cocaethylene, which is very bad for your heart.</li>
            <li>Never do psychedelics (LSD, mushrooms, 2C-B, etc) if you have a family history of schizophrenia or other mental illness.</li>
            <li>Smoking anything is bad for you, because combusted plant matter has all sorts of harmful stuff in it.</li>
            <li>Don't do drugs alone.</li>
            <li>Don't be stupid.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Consent</h2>
        <p>Consent means that everyone involved wants and agrees to be present at each step of the way. Consent is an explicit yes!</p>
        <p>Consent must be given for any activity (kissing, touching, sexual intercourse).</p>
        <p>Go over your boundaries with your partner, a friend, or a manager before substances are used. Continue to check in with that person through out the night. </p>
        <p>Body language is not reliable when it comes to consent.</p>
        <p>You can never assume someone is giving you consent.</p>
        <p>Consent must be given freely and knowingly, rather than by coercion, threat, or intimidation.</p>
        <p>You can change your mind at any time before or during the activity.</p>

        <p>Ways to ask for consent:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Are you into this?</li>
            <li>How are you feeling?</li>
            <li>Would you like it if I ______?</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="waste">
        <h1>Offal Attrition</h1>
        <h2>Where to put bottles and cans, broken glass, cardboard, electronics, whippits:</h2>

        <p>All bottles and cans go in the blue bins against the wall in the hallway between the common room and the 200s. Broken glass bins are on the opposite wall. Cardboard goes in the two large rolling bins just outside this hallway, other mixed paper can be placed here too (there is a small bin placed there now.)</p>

        <p>Electronics, whippits, styrofoam and batteries that have come to the end of their useful life go on the shelf in the same hallway as the bottles and cans.</p>

        <h2>Where to empty trash, cardboard, compost and bottles:</h2>

        <p>Please empty personal trash in the dumpster on Floor L (take the elevator), mixed paper and compost dumpsters are also placed here. Make sure to put the brick in the door because it locks behind you.</p>

        <p>Also, if you could separate your room's trash into landfill and recycling that would be wonderful! Landfill costs money to haul away while recycling does not!</p>

        <p>Cans/Bottles go out to the blue rolling dumpsters at the entrance of CZ. </p>

        <h2>What to do if the bins in the loading dock are full.</h2>

        <p>If the bins in the loading dock are full, contact me, my email is satkinson@berkeley.edu, otherwise just hold off on placing trash/compost/recycling there until further notice. </p>

    </div>
    <!-- Mail section -->
    <div id="mail">
        <h1>CZPS</h1>
        <p>Mail is delivered to CZ every day except Sunday, usually around lunchtime in one or two batches. Every Czar has a pigeonhole, into which the Male-Manager or his trusty Male-Boy (collectively known as the Males) sort the letters each afternoon.</p>
        <p>Packages are locked up next to the pigeonholes, and recorded on a nearby whiteboard. If a Czar sees their name on the whiteboard, they give one of the Males a text or a call or a visit . On Fridays, the Male-team clear out the package locker by delivering the packages to people's rooms, in costume. </p>
        <p>Junk mail is recycled, and mail for ex-Czars is stored until they come and collect, or until CO finds out their forwarding address for the Males.</p>
        <p>There is an outgoing mail box for the postmen, but they usually just ignore it.</p>
        <p>As Benjamin Franklin so famously said; "By mailing to prepare, you are preparing to mail."</p>

    <!-- Board section -->
    <div id="board">
        <h1>Representation</h1>
        <p> The mission of the BSC is, "to provide housing to students pursuing a university education that would not otherwise be able to afford it." Board is in charge of maintaining that mission.</p>

        <p>General focuses include: raising habitability standards at the houses, ensuring efficiency and productivity of the Central Food Supply, manager training, and workshift.</p>

        <p> Board is currently debating the existence of house-level boarders and how they affect food on a central level. They are reforming central level workshifts to be representative of the members they are serving. </p>

        <p> Board is also discussing the reformation of checkout slips. Checkout slips are how the BSC fines members who do not complete their required workshift. This money is funneled back into the individual house checking accounts after each semester. The money is intended to be used to incentivize extra workshift in order to raise habitability standards. Currently many of the houses use this money as a discretionary fund and not to pay workshifters.</p>

        <p> Each house elects a board representative. This Board Rep represents his/her individual house while maintaining the mission of the BSC as a whole. Board Reps are required to attend the five board meetings that occur each semester. These meetings start at 7pm and typically end at 1am. Each board rep must also attend a weekly three hour meeting with their assigned committee. Committees include: Education and Training, Finance, Operations, Capital Affairs and Human Resources.</p>
