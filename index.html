                <ul>
                    <li>The vacuums are generally found in front of the maintenance room. The maintenance room is on the 10's floor, directly left at the bottom of the stairs. </li>
                    <li>The vacuums are backpacks with long hoses connected to silver pipes for extension.</li>
                    <li>If they are not here, then check to see if someone else is using it before going to the maintenance manager. </li>

                    <li>The extension cord plugs into the backpack near the waist belt and also near the power switch. </li>
                    <li>Before using it, make sure the bag is empty. To do this unscrew the top of the canister and remove the cylindrical bag and filter. Empty the bag into the trash and gently remove the dust from the filter.  </li>
                    <li>Replace the bag and make sure the intake port is free of debris. </li>
                    <li>If, while vacuuming it does not seem to be working, make sure the intake is not clogged. If it is not clogged and the problem persists, you may need to remove the canister lid and make sure there is nothing in the black tubing by clearing it with a broom handle or the like. </li>

                <li>Use 1/4 cup of bleach for 1 gallon of cold water (1 tablespoon for 1 quart)</li>

        <h1>Expressive Dynamism</h1>
        <h2>What HI is</h2>
        <p>Home Improvement means everything from maintaining the luxuries we already have, to adding/building/growing more fantastic aspects to our house. Improvement can cover anything from painting a wooden chair to make it look fabulous, to building a three-dimensional garden to grow herbs and flowers. HI managers gain access to the maintenance room and all its tools, so construction projects are made easier. HI managers gain high levels of responsibility in this role: they are able to make small decisions by themselves, such as “Should this rose stay here or be moved to the other side of the Bee Garden?” However, they must consult the house on larger decisions, such as “Shall we spend $500 on installing lawn onto our wooden trellis in the courtyard?” One of the most important aspects of their duties is to aid and assist other members of the house in completing their required HI hours (5 hours during Fall and Spring, 3 hours during Summer semesters). In order to do this, they must repeatedly remind house members of their duties. They must also inspire members with project ideas, assist them in their completion, and ensure safety at all times.
        </p>
        <h2>Notable Projects</h2>
        <p>In the semester just past, Summer 2013, HI included a complete renovation of the Bee Garden from a weeded jungle into a relaxing, open space, ready for grass to be installed. Members also constructed a new, large and secure book case in the study room, as well as cataloguing and sorting our massive library. CZars helped clear the Red Room of excessive amounts of trash and junk furniture, and transform the room into an open, inhabitable space ready for further renovation. During summer, the HI budget was used to purchase everything from shelf brackets, spray paint and glue, to moka pots, hammocks and music stands. Historically, HI has included huge projects, such as the electronic light-board in the common room, the stripper stage, the vegetable cabinet, huge wooden planters and incredibly intricate murals.
        </p>
        <h2>Current Projects</h2>
        <p>
         This coming semester, Fall 2013, it is important that the HI manager finish many projects that were unable to be completed heretofore. Firstly, sod needs to be purchased from Home Depot between 9am-11am on a weekday, and for this to happen, a CZar must borrow the truck from Central Kitchen. As far as I know, only Max French has access to this truck (this is why it was too difficult to get sod in the last few weeks of summer, as Max and Karandeep were busy every morning). Furthermore, the books that were deemed useless to the house were packaged into 10 large boxes, ready to be moved to Half Price Books and sold. Unfortunately, no member was able to transport these books during the last weeks of summer. It is imperative that these are removed from the common space as they are obstructing spaces used by CZars on a daily basis. The library budget Hilary Ojeda passed in Spring 2013 still has over $1,500 left to spend. This should be utilised to carry on the renovation of the study room: new furniture and book shelves, perhaps. Furthermore, much interest was shown during council for arcade machines to be purchased for the Red Room, to aid its renovation. Moreover, comfortable furniture needs to be purchased for the Red Room and other common spaces. This should be done in time for the cold months, when snuggling up in front of the Red Room fire with a book and hot chocolate is an essential aspect of CZars’ weekly routines.
        </p>
        <h2> Brainstorming Potential Projects </h2>
        <p>The best thing to do is talk to CZars about the house, and what they could do to improve it. It’s incredible how imaginative everyone in this house is. Ideas can easily snowball, so proposing projects during council is also a good idea. It is best to test the water with straw-polls before moving to an official budget vote.
        </p>
        <h2>Investing in the place in which you live</h2>
        <p>
It’s incredibly important that members improve the house they inhabit and love. CZ is a microcosm of the real world; it requires nurture and attention and love. Without your help, future generations of students will not be able to enjoy it as much as you have. It is tiring to rebuild a house that receives so much abuse, but it is important to be hopeful, imaginative and optimistic. Countless CZars have poured huge portions of their lives into maintaing and improving this house — don’t let them down!
