                                    <li>The most important thing to remember with sign-off's is accountability. With accountability czars assume responsibility of their living conditions. This allows the great nation of Krackistan the ability to grow more powerful with a unified front of ultimate co-op supremacy.  Without accountability we live in a perpetual state of working harder than necessary to barely reach a passable living condition, instead of flourishing in the amazing resource that is Casa Zimbabwe.</li>
